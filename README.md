Organizing the Allied Media Conference

  Tracks, Practice Spaces, Network Gatherings (TPSNGs)
  The conference sessions are organized around its TPSNGs.  The Allied Media Partnership (AMP) creates a Google Form for users to propose TPSNGs. For each submission, the Work Department generates an Etherpad, in which the organizers can discuss the proposal and finalize a list of TPSNGs for the conference.
  
  Session Proposals
  Once the organizers finalize the TPSNGs, they broadcast another Google Form, asking users to propose a session for the Tracks or Practice Spaces (Network Gatherings do not have sessions, but instead are events themselves). In 2016, there were more than 400 submissions. For each submission, the Work Department generates an Etherpad, in which the organizers can discuss the proposal.  Furthermore, to organize all the submissions, the Work Department creates a Table of Contents Etherpad as well.
  After a couple months of discussion and deliberation, the organizers decide which sessions they will host at the AMC.
