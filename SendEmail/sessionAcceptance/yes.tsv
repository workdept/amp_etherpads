This panel brings together 7 micropress, small press, and artist publishers, working in several modes and with several press models. We'll ask: what is micropress publishing? What are its economics?

The moment our work is made Deliverable — as object, performance, digital file, social media post — it begins its adult life where it is engaged, tested, and shaped by those tests.

Feel free to look at the manifesto that this session is going to be based off of here: http://rebirthgarments.com/radical-visibility-zine/  It is very important to us that our space is fully ADA Accessible, including but not limited to Wheelchair accessible, scent free (or very low scent), temperature and lighting control. Also, it would be nice if it was a more spacious open format space. We also may have other presenters with us, but Compton and I (Sky) are the main ones. Thanks!

This session explores the connections between organizing, sci-fi/fantasy, and liberation. The Social Justice Warrior Collective will present our children's superhero comic book and outline our process for creating a superhero that transforms oppression into power. We will facilitate a hands-on workshop with participants to create their own social justice warriors. Together, these superheroes will destroy oppressive systems while building a more just world. 	#justwarrior	Hands-on Session (a 90 minute session that engages multiple senses in the learning process and allows participants to construct their own knowledge)	Everyone	Using art and storytelling, we will connect social movements with sci-fi/fantasy speculative fiction. Accessible to all ages, this medium gives us the power to imagine and create characters with the power to destroy oppressive systems and build community through collaborative play, visioning, and resistance. It is a way to link struggles and to write our liberation into the past/present/future. Our aim is to process trauma and pain into collective healing, resistance, and movement building.

We have four core characters who each face intersecting forms of oppression. From their experiences of harm, pain, and trauma, they each develop special powers to disrupt the systems that harm them, their families, and friends while uplifting and rebuilding their communities.
