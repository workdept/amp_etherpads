Textile artist Rachel Wallis will talk about her collaborative quilting projects addressing issues of race and power. During the session, we will engage in a collaborative sewing project. Participants will gain hands on experience with basic sewing/embroidery and a deeper understanding of the ways textiles can be used as a strategy for research, community building, and organizing. 	#sewingresistance	Hands-on Session (a 90 minute session that engages multiple senses in the learning process and allows participants to construct their own knowledge)	Everyone	I use collaborative quilting to engage in grassroots education and organizing. My projects include Gone But Not Forgotten, a community memorial quilt for people killed by the Chicago Police, and Unraveling Empire, a collaborative quilting project mapping the links between the textile trade and the slave economy in the 18th and 19th century. I see my work as a strategy for using research, storytelling, and sewing to address the history of white supremacy and to build movements for justice.

Her current work focuses on collaborative community quilting projects exploring the history impact of white supremacy in the US. 																										No sewing experience is necessary for the workshop, and I will bring all the necessary supplies. I'm interested in using the workshop and perhaps a drop-in sewing space to create a textile piece specifically for the AMC. My thought was to have participants embroider text related to art and resistance, and collect them into a small quilt that could be displayed at the end of the conference. I'm totally open to suggestions/changes to the theme or process of creating the piece.

Performance art can ask deep and resonate questions that push people outside of their comfort zone and asks them to look at a topic from a different perspective.

Resistance paradigms are not as effective in a world where communication has transformed drastically, however, radical action coupled with creative visual and emotional cues has the power to hijack the media and shift public perception.

By juxtaposing images, sounds, testimonies and narratives of the outsider with those of the people living there, we will collectively create an imaginary of the resilience, the joy, the heartening activism and mobility for social change, and the valuable flow of cultures and identities contained in the U.S-Mexico border. Participants will walk away understanding the importance of looking beyond dominant narratives and discourses, and instead search, listen and analyze the social imaginaries constructed by the voices, histories, music, performances, images and genealogies of the communities living in the borderlands.

Hundreds of people were arrested for non-violent, civil disobedience. As a result, the federal government bought 7,500 acres to create the Headwaters Forest Preserve.  In Houston, Texas in 2006, after a month-long strike, thousands of janitors who had been earning poverty wages, doubled their incomes and won health insurance for the first time. Most of the workers were women who had immigrated from Mexico and Central America. By going on strike, many were risking deportation.  Organizers of both these struggles told Eesha Williams that journalism in locally-owned news outlets helped their cause, while the corporate media either ignored them, or provided hostile coverage.   In December 2014, in Oakland, California, anti-prison activists held a rally outside a meeting of the county legislature. They were asking the Alameda county board of supervisors to invest $17 million a year in programs to keep people out of prison by creating jobs for people just getting out of prison. The board rejected the activists' request. The activists kept returning to the board's meetings and speaking out during the public comment period. But the board kept rejecting their request. On March 4, 2015, the activists returned to a county board meeting. This time they were ready to get arrested for non-violent civil disobedience. They interrupted the meeting by singing songs from the civil rights movement. The board quickly ended the meeting. Soon, the activists won. They got the $17 million.  There are two main newspapers in Oakland, the Oakland Tribune and the East Bay Express. The Tribune is owned by a corporation in Colorado that owns dozens of other newspapers around the nation. The East Bay Express is owned by a group of local people in Oakland.  There are several radio and TV stations that cover Oakland news. One of them is KPFA, a non-profit radio station whose board of directors is elected by anyone who donates $35 a year or volunteers four hours a year. KPFA rejects the corporate money that NPR stations rely on.  Darris Young was the main organizer of the protests at the Alameda county board of supervisors meeting. Williams spoke with him in September 2015. Young said the East Bay Express provided coverage that helped turn out people for the protest in March. He said the Tribune did not. KPFA has covered his group's work better than the commercial radio and TV stations.

Through discussion and exercises we will explore how triggers are created and how to track the root of triggers in our body to the trauma where they originated. Participants will learn some basic techniques for engaging the wisdom of our body to transform the trauma at the root of our triggers and retrieve the power, wisdom and forward movement they contain.	HealingTriggers	Panel/Presentation (an interesting and engaging 90 minute presentation followed by Q&A. Panels with multiple speakers should include a moderator)	Everyone	Communities of marginalized peoples are frequently torn apart by trauma members possess due to colonialist, hetero-patriarchal and white supremacist violence. When we are easily triggered, whatever story we have to share with each other or the world is distorted. To create strong communities, we must learn tools for addressing our trauma at it's root and learning to come back into wholeness and love within ourselves. In doing so we become immune to the wedges fascism strives to drive between us.	1	Yes	Langston	Langston.Kahn@gmail.com	2017905607	Occupy Your Heart	Langston Kahn is a shamanic practitioner specializing in emotional clearing and radical transformation.

Yet the voice—disembodied, ventriloquized, multiple, denatured, echoed, silenced, queer, vulnerable, racialized, gendered, authoritative—is a construct that invariably exists in excess of its own construction.

Hacking Diversity: As educators in libraries, museums, and other institutions, how can we take advantage of existing “diversity and inclusion” initiatives to achieve more radical social change? Diversity initiatives often take “all lives matter” approaches to avoid conflict and controversy, failing to make the reparations they say they want to accomplish. As queer and POC staff, faculty and students in these institutions, we know this is not enough.  In this session, we will collectively explore practices of hacking diversity for social justice. We will discuss strategies of harnessing social media, new media, and learning management systems; developing inclusive online and in-person classroom pedagogies; and directing “diversity” funds and resources to truly support grassroots organizations, archives, and communities. Participants will leave with new ideas and strategies for working within their own institutions.

Historically, security tools are notoriously hard to use and generally seen as only for experts thus excluding a vast majority of the population. In this session, I will give a background on the issue, present a re-framing on how security and usability are integrally linked, then engage in a ~45min prototyping activity to give participants hands-on experience with user testing. 	#UsableSecurity	Hands-on Session (a 90 minute session that engages multiple senses in the learning process and allows participants to construct their own knowledge)	Intermediate	Media-based organizing is core to this session. Simply, as the world becomes digital, people need to understand how to manage their digital selves. That includes both sharing and not sharing. That is handled through security (or privacy) controls which many people find cumbersome or inaccessible. By encouraging designers to embrace usability, we actually improve democratic participation in a rapidly digitizing public.	1	No	Morgan Miller	MorganMillerUX@gmail.com	503-349-5292	Morgan Miller UX (my freelance company)	While studying cryptography in graduate school, I was amazed how most difficult most security tools were to use.

I have had the joy of working with many smart people to help build systems that meet business goals (security, profit, etc) and support user needs.  Please see http://MorganMillerUX.com																										I have given a couple forms of this talk as an invited speaker at Galois, at Open Source Bridge conference, and at Portland BSides. The interactive activity is a new addition that I think will be fun, provide peer learning opportunities, and be a way to give hands on tactics for envisioning privacy/security features in systems that are designed as well as user testing.

I will transform the youth's perception by illuminating the positive and negative characteristics of hip hop, while attaining the attention of higher education administrators and hip hop leaders to realize that hip hop is a way of life for many Black youth.  	3	Yes	Dr. TashaDavis	tlong522@gmail.com	630-429-6143	Sisters of Survival	Dr. Tasha G. Davis is a hip hop artist, writer, and scholar born and raised in Cabrini Green, a housing project located in the inner city of Chicago; this is where her journey to education began.  Dr. Davis is the Associate Dean of Correctional Programs at Lake Land College where she is responsible for the coordination of vocational and academic post-secondary programs, while acting as liaison between the community college and the Department of Juvenile Justice Youth Center in St. Charles IL.																										U.S educational systems are built on the traditional models of superior and inferior beings.  The pedagogy, curriculum and history being taught only encourage, support, and uplift White privilege leaving many underrepresented underserved people of color excluded in traditional classrooms.  Discriminatory, separate but equal teachings of inferiority are being schooled into the minds of Black youth, leaving them insecure, uninspired, uneducated and incarcerated.  When Black girls and Black boys do not fit into the constructs of the traditional models of education, many are being disciplined and held accountable for challenging the policies of systematic oppression; these are methodical foundations upon which slavery were built.  The institution upon which slavery was built has a direct impact on the culture of hip-hop.  Tricia Rose's definition of hip hop is used to ground the perspective of girls and women of color in the culture of hip hop.  Hip-hop according to Tricia Rose's definition is an “Afrodiasporic music genre born in 1970's New York, and offers a bridge between non-traditional ways of knowing and traditional curricula.  Music and cultural critics praise rap's role as an educational tool, point out that Black women rappers are rare examples of aggressive pro-women lyricists, and defend rap's ghetto stories as real life reflections that should draw attention to the burning problems of racism and economic oppression” (Rose 1994, p.1).  The conversation of inclusion is necessary with college administrators who design traditional curriculum, and with the music writers and admirers that generate and stimulate the culture of hip hop music.  Women and girls being embodied as leaders in the culture of hip-hop will have a direct impact on the exclusion they face on college campuses and as trailblazers in the genre of rap.  The culture of hip hop must become part of higher education interchange through a diversified curriculum developed as a college course.  The culture of hip-hop needs to be dissected, making connections to the lived experiences of underrepresented Black girls/women and their socially oppressed marginalized identities. Hip hop must serve as a radical resistance against systematic oppression, as a form of education, and be responsible for the messages that are being sent to Black youth today.  The culture of hip hop can serve as a critical pedagogy and educational movement used by Black men and Black women to help obtain knowledge of self, while bridging the gap to end mass incarceration, systematic traditional White privileged curriculum, and create diversity and inclusion within our institutions of education.  Mass incarceration is another form of systematic oppression that was established to enslave and destroy the lives of Black people from underserved communities.  Mass incarceration affects the lives of many poor Black men and Black women, leaving the Black family destroyed for generations.   Many working class Black women are bread winners, and serve as the head of their household. When a Black mother is incarcerated, her children are exposed to similar dysfunctions that plagued her life, which leads to generational imprisonment.  Systematic oppression, generational confinement, and White Privilege are the stimulus used to develop the school to prison pipeline for Black men and women.  In order to bring visibility to the oppressions of Black men and women in U.S. institutions of education, and U.S. systems of justice there must be a positive dialogue about Black women in culture of hip hop.  Through the use of a Critical Black Female Street Pedagogy (Davis Long, 2016), Black women will have a voice and framework that can be used to describe their lived experiences, leading to awareness, constructive rehabilitation, mental health, inclusion in the hip hop culture, and social justice.
