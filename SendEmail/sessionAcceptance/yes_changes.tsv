More people are becoming interested in the concepts of transformative justice and community accountability as collective approaches to respond to harms within our communities. This workshop will provide concrete suggestions and steps for how to start facilitating TJ/CA processes. The workshop focuses on practical information and steps about how to begin planning a process for maximum effectiveness.  	#CANowWhat	Strategy Session (a 90-minute session that focuses collective brain power around hard questions and generates clear next steps)	Intermediate	This workshop is the basis of a zine in the making. The zine will invite community accountability process facilitators to self-assess and to troubleshoot a number of issues that regularly arise.

Here is the full description of our workshop:  So you've decided to facilitate a community accountability process… Now what?  More people are becoming interested in the concepts of transformative justice and community accountability as collective approaches to respond to harms within our communities. This workshop will provide concrete suggestions and steps for how to start facilitating TJ/CA processes. Many TJ/CA processes fail before they even begin because people haven't adequately planned from the start. The workshop assumes that participants are already familiar with the basic concepts and principles of transformative justice. As such, the focus is on practical information and steps about how to plan a process for maximum effectiveness. We will discuss facilitator self-assessment, preparing all stakeholders, and setting expectations/goals for the TJ/CA process.

People from any experience level with physical interfaces can discuss the designs of current controllers and how they are in/accessible. Participants working together will learn from this discussion ways to spot and counter the progression of inaccessibility in tech and as well to create methods of play solely to be experienced by those with disabilities.	#CripCtrl	Lunch Meetup (a 1-hour focused discussion amongst a specific group with a shared identity or interest)	Everyone	Within this group discussion individuals will take things learned and bring it back to their own communities, organizations, and practices and start seriously putting accessibility under a microscope to work towards defining and ensuring accessibility for all. Accessibility is something that is in dire need to be a priority in all organization and practice as the impact and exclusion of those who need accommodations greatly impacts their livelihoods. 	1	Yes	Elliot Pines	asmolghost@gmail.com		647-687-5212	Dames Making Games	Elliot Pines is queer, non-binary, cripster game developer, maker, and disability activist working out of Toronto.

She has participated in numerous panel discussions on animation and games, collaborated on several bizarre interactive projects, and organized workshops promoting digital media outreach and literacy. For more information: http://www.saganyee.com/about																					For the past four years in Toronto/Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, Game Curious has facilitated themed arcades and game-making workshops for youth in underserved neighbourhoods, public libraries, and schools.  Video games have the potential to be a medium for people on the margins to share their lived experience and artistic practice on a digital platform, as well as for communities to build contexts for themselves. However, the medium is often believed to be a solely commercialized outlet meant for mainstream narratives and formal skills development is often only available for those who can afford post-secondary education, a financial barrier compounded by the lack of racial, sexual, and gender diversity in the field.Recently, the Hand Eye Society adapted Game Curious into an open source template, working with independent creators across Canada to start Game Curious Montreal and Game Curious Vancouver. The proposed session will introduce dialogue on how Detroit may similarly find use for a community initiative like Game Curious functioning as a vehicle for localized game literacy.

Chicana scholar, poet, and activist Gloria Anzaldua defined the U.S.- Mexican border as “an open wound where the third world grates against the first and bleeds.” Media representations, academic scholars and fiction writers have focused only on the bleeding of the wound, constructing the borderlands as a space of social death: a space defined only by the violence resulting from the power struggle between drug cartels, by the feminicide and impunity in cities like Ciudad Juarez, and by the deathly effects of the Maquiladora industry environmental pollution and the lack of governmental laws and regulations. Contrasting the outsider perception of the borderlands as a region that only embodies pain, suffering, trauma, violence and death, our session will highlight the struggle, resilience and resistance of individuals and communities living and thriving in this region, highlighting their sense of social agency and their cultural capacity to construct spaces of hope. By juxtaposing images, sounds, testimonies and narratives of the outsider with those of the people living there, we will collectively create an imaginary of the resilience, the joy, the heartening activism and mobility for social change, and the valuable flow of cultures and identities contained in the U.S-Mexico border. Participants will walk away understanding the importance of looking beyond dominant narratives and discourses, and instead search, listen and analyze the social imaginaries constructed by the voices, histories, music, performances, images and genealogies of the communities living in the borderlands.

He was a key designer of the largest climate mobilization in history, The People's Climate March. 						We would like to discuss the following possibilities with you.   The Argus Project is a transmedia project that includes (1) An emotionally powerful video installation, (2) A futuristic, wearable exo-suit (think ‘Iron Man' but for cop watching) and (3) Participatory trainings. We would be excited to bring multiple parts of the project to AMC as an alternative or supplemental program, as we believe it would be highly inspiring to AMC's network of media activists,  and set the stage for going powerful work together.   VIDEO: The video installation,  first set up for Tribeca Film Festival, explores the issue of police violence from multiple perspectives, featuring family members of victims of police violence, veteran police officers and grassroots activists. In emotionally resonant and deeply personal interviews, the main characters discuss the impacts of systemic racism on society, the pervasive surveillance of low income communities of color, and the profound change brought about by courageous citizen videographers who are now “watching back.”  The installation is shown across 3 screens, and loops every 30 minutes.  It can be installed in it's own room, creating an experience for people to come through at their own pace.  It would require a sound system, as well as some funding to ship projection equipment (screens, projectors, media players) from NYC.  Here are excerpts from the video: https://vimeo.com/185745057  EXOSUIT: The Exosuit is a futuristic suit of wearable, counter-surveillance body armor that is embedded with cameras and other technology designed to protect the wearer and monitor the police. It references afro-futurism, pop-culture and sci-fi. It can be displayed as an art piece and if possible, even worn by users. Including it in the run of AMC would require shipping the outfit from NYC to Detroit.    TRAININGS: The Trainings cover topics  “Know Your Rights”, the 200 year history of community lead police monitoring, envisioning community safety in the absence of police, and designing new tools to help empower communities to take back control.They are best paired with a screening of the 30 minute video and would require a room and anywhere from 10-30 participants.  We would love to discuss with you the possibility of bringing these creative, powerful elements to AMC.
