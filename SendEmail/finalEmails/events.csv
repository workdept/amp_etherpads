In Detroit, the absence of healing, truth and reconciliation around the events of 1967 is a defining feature of our cultural and political landscape, constricting what we can become. Drawing on the wisdom of Detroit movement elder Shea Howell, sonic healer Sterling Toles, and time-traveler poet Dr. Alexis Pauline Gumbs, this plenary will chart visions of a future that are grounded in the complexity of the present and the past. <br /> <br /> Live performance by Bandelero and light refreshments will be offered. Directly following, be sure head over to the One Mile x AMC2017 after party hosted by the Detroit Culture Council.

A story from one place and time may be enough to lead one or two, or a million people to act in another place and time, sparking new uprisings, which in turn, become new stories. Rebecca Solnit describes this cyclical, yet unpredictable relationship between movements and stories as grounds for hope. She writes, &ldquo;Hope locates itself in the premises that we don&rsquo;t know what will happen. And in that spaciousness of uncertainty there is room to act.&rdquo; This plenary will explore how stories became movements, then became stories in the context of Standing Rock, the Movement for Black Lives, the movement to end caste-based sexual violence in India, and why we need to save the Internet to keep our stories alive and circulating.","","","","","0","74","N","DeRoy Auditorium","","","","Everyone","","","","","","","","76621cb961828e70a07092b110b0ff67","613494","Malkia Cyril, Thenmozhi Soundararajan, Jenni Monet, Paige Watkins","Jenny Lee","","","",""

Collaboration will.” As we gather in Detroit for the 19th annual Allied Media Conference, we are recharging our trusted super powers and synthesizing new ones. We are drawing power from movement histories and ancestral technologies. We are laying mesh networks between movements, issues, and identities. We are learning our way into emergent strategies, trusting uncertainty and seeing the large-scale implications of our smallest-scale relationships. <br /> <br /> The AMC2017 Opening Ceremony will reflect all of this. Alicia Garza of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and co-founder of #BlackLivesMatter will give a keynote, sharing her perspectives on the power of media, art, and technology in our movements today. Scott Kurashige, author of The Fifty Year Rebellion, will ground the work of AMC in the context of Detroit as an international model for survival, resistance, and solidarity.
