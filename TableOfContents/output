The Abundant Bodies Track will challenge the ongoing ways mainstream media shames and harms abundant bodies, name fat phobia in our organizing and activism, and create media and practical strategies for resistance, healing and community building. We will broaden the conversation around fat activism by centering this track on the voices of indigenous, Black, people of color, dis/abled, super-sized, trans and queer fat folks. Abundant/thick/fat bodies are the target of so much hate, policing and negativity, even in our organizing communities. Through workshops, panels and skillshares we will transform mainstream ideas around abundant bodies and create resilient communities, media and art that celebrates our bodies!<br><br>Coordinators: Linda Dianne, Amanda Levitt, annie chen, KC Slack, Najee Haynes-Follins, Kytara Epps<br><br><br><u>INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRACK COORDINATORS:</u>

The Building Climate Resilient Communities Track will explore community-led strategies to move beyond fossil fuel and consumer-based societies and adapt to face increasing climate change impacts. In order to build resiliency and sustainability in our communities, we will explore some of the most transformative and exciting alternatives to the drivers of climate change including DIY personal and collective projects and large scale infrastructure such as microgrids and post-disaster communication hubs. Participants will walk away with tools to reimagine their communities and relationships to each other, while also preparing to navigate climate change.<br>**Our track upholds three core climate justice values, which for us include: (1) centering and following the leadership of communities most impacted by climate change; (2) addressing its root causes; and (3) opposing oppressive systems and practices that exploit our communities.<br><br>Coordinators: Ceci Pineda, Brenda Salas, Antonio Cosme, Kat Yang-Stevens<br><br><br><u>INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRACK COORDINATORS:</u>

The Radical Librarianship Track will address a broad range of media-based organizing themes: envisioning libraries and archives as centers for supporting movements for social equity; as information providers for social justice workers; and as places to explore how to use art, media, and technology for social transformation. In this track we will specifically consider the role of librarians and archivists in strengthening the knowledge, culture, and collective memory of communities impacted by chronic divestment and gentrification.<br><br>Coordinators: Katie Dover-Taylor, Andrea Pérez, Heidy Berthoud, Benjamin Miller, Celeste Re<br><br><br><u>INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRACK COORDINATORS:</u>

The Resourcing and Sustaining our Movements Track will investigate and examine grassroots fundraising how-tos, self and community care strategies, alternative economic models (i.e. co-ops, gift economies, etc.), grassroots entrepreneurship and the role of media, art and technology in supporting it all. Through participatory workshops, one-on-one consulting, skill shares, and peer networking spaces, we will explore how to grow the resources we need for our movements and communities to thrive. Whether you are starting a collective, operating a small business, working as an independent artist, running a nonprofit, or work outside of traditional non-profit structures – this space is for you! We will walk away with new fundraising ideas, relationships, and the spirit of collaboration, solidarity, and abundance.<br><br>Coordinators: Tanya Mote, Crystal Middlestadt, Allison Budschalow<br><br><br><u>INSTRUCTIONS FOR TRACK COORDINATORS:</u>
