Dear #{presenter_name},<br/>
<br/>
The AMC2017 schedule <a href="https://amc2017.sched.com/">is now online!</a> With over 250 sessions and special events, there’s a lot happening. It’s a good idea to start promoting your session so people in your network can bookmark it in the online schedule and plan to attend. <br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas on how to promote:
<ul>
<li> Share the link to your session. You can find the link by visiting amc2017.sched.com and searching for your session title. Make your post more personal by saying why you are excited about the session </li>
<li>Share the attached custom graphic to help get the word out. </li>
<li>Make sure to use the hashtag #AMC2017 in your promotions.</li>
<br/>
<br/>
</ul>
We will see you very soon at AMC2017!
