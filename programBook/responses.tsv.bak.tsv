The historical account of those archival material weaves a personal story of growing up as north Korean minority in Japan. Kum deconstruct images we ordinarily find in our everyday lives and reweaves through her fictional story telling of North Koreans in Japan. Note: Could be one of her short videos as well.   Angela Melitopolous Passing Drama 2000, 01:06:00 Passing Drama is based on various refugees' testimonies. Drama is a small city in Northern Greece. Drama in Greek means either stage, narrative or theatre play. Drama is inhabited by refugees (including my grand-parents) who lived through the deportation in Asia Minor toward Greece in 1923. During World War II, their children fled from Bulgarian occupation and became slaves in Hitler's Germany. Interviews with those refugees and my father's narrative of his departure from Greece to Vienna relate an oblique path across Europe. Although refugees were considered a mass phenomenon for the first time with the decline of the Austro-Hungarian, the Ottoman and the Russian Empire, the idea that these refugees had no nationality was never tackled in the history of the countries involved. PASSING DRAMA was conceived as a hypertext structure of images and sounds visualizing memories and remembrance, thanks to the techniques of non-linear editing. This film expresses the point of view of a minority whose past seems to have been eaten out by industrial machines for the privileges of the majority.   Larissa Sansour A Space Exodus (2009) Video, 5' 24'' A Space Exodus quirkily sets up an adapted stretch of Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey in a Middle Eastern political context. The recognisable music scores of the 1968 science fiction film are changed to arabesque chords matching the surreal visuals of Sansour's film. The film follows the artist herself onto a phantasmagoric journey through the universe echoing Stanley Kubrick's thematic concerns for human evolution, progress and technology. However, in her film, Sansour posits the idea of a first Palestinian into space, and, referencing Armstrong's moon landing, she interprets this theoretical gesture as 'a small step for a Palestinian, a giant leap for mankind”. The film offers a naively hopeful and optimistic vision for a Palestinian future contrasting sharply with all the elements that are currently eating away at the very idea of a viable Palestinian state. In A Space Exodus, Sansour does finally reach the moon, although her contact with Palestine's capital is cut off. This five-minute short is packed with highly produced visual imagery. The arabesque elements ranging from the space suit to the music are merged within a dreamy galactic setting and elaborate special effects. A great deal of attention is paid to every detail of the film to create a never before seen case of thrillingly magical Palestinian displacement.   Flotel Europa Vladimir Tomic In 1992, a wave of refugees from the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina reached Denmark. With refugee camps completely full, the Red Cross pulled a giant ship into the canals of Copenhagen. The ship, Flotel Europa, became a temporary home for a thousand people waiting for decisions on their asylum applications. Among them was a young boy, Vladimir, who fled Sarajevo together with his mother and older brother. They spent two years in the limbo of Flotel Europa. Two decades later, Vladimir Tomic takes us on a journey of growing up on this ship filled with echoes of the war plus music, sports, girls and all the other things that make up an adolescence. 70 min.

How can we help you disrupt history today?	http://etherpad.alliedmedia.org/p/2017_Test_Session_hello_how_can_we_help_you_disrup	Disrupting Mainstream History Track	Hello! How can we help you disrupt history today?	Meaningful acts of disruption begin with one conversation. Come share your projects/ideas to disrupt mainstream history. This casual meetup is open to all, but the conversation could touch on community-based archives, oral history projects, libraries, and/or student and professional experiences at academic institutions that navigate power dynamics and challenge institutionalized diversity, racism, and whiteness. We hope participants will connect with potential co-disruptors and/or collaboratively identify tangible actions to help support their projects. 	#stormthepalace	Strategy Session (a 90-minute session that focuses collective brain power around hard questions and generates clear next steps)	Intermediate	Using real-time polling technology, we can share experiences to create strategies. We hope to build a community to confront powers that actively silence history and foster ongoing engagement via new media. By listening to one another and exploring hard issues together, we hope to challenges ourselves and strengthen our communities. As people of color, the co-facilitators challenged the mainstream via media-based organizing while in graduate school, which is the inspiration for this session.

As a product of Chinese and Filipino immigration to the plantations of Hawai'i in the 1880s, she hopes to continue preserving the diversity of voices within the Asian American community. 																					More complete version of our proposal: Intentional acts of disruption, large or small, begin with one inspiring conversation, so we would like to engage in dialogue with others to collaboratively identify actionable steps that will help launch/support their project(s) to disrupt history. Our session consists of three components: 1) Co-facilitators will share their graduate school experiences as archivists-in-training of color and their projects of disruption; 2) Co-disruptors will be encouraged to share their experiences/concerns and project ideas; and 3) Co-disruptors will be polled in real time* to assess the various projects of disruption for us to collectively strategize for, and also to engage with questions that relate to archives, the production of history, higher education, identity, institutionalized diversity, power, privilege, racism, and whiteness. ...Because contributing to an elite system while also trying to dismantle its oppressive power structures requires a community.

Self-representation and self-determination are key elements in the creation and dissemination of Indigenous media. As a tool, media has become form and forum for youth, educators, organizers and marginalized communities to reclaim and reframe the possibilities of enacting self-representation and empowering cultural futures. How are our historically-marginalized communities using media and technology to make their  stories visible? How can these perspectives and approaches be implemented in organizations, media outlets and in institutions? Finally, what does it look like to be embedded in this process?

He was a key designer of the largest climate mobilization in history, The People's Climate March. 						We would like to discuss the following possibilities with you.   The Argus Project is a transmedia project that includes (1) An emotionally powerful video installation, (2) A futuristic, wearable exo-suit (think ‘Iron Man’ but for cop watching) and (3) Participatory trainings. We would be excited to bring multiple parts of the project to AMC as an alternative or supplemental program, as we believe it would be highly inspiring to AMC’s network of media activists,  and set the stage for going powerful work together.   VIDEO: The video installation,  first set up for Tribeca Film Festival, explores the issue of police violence from multiple perspectives, featuring family members of victims of police violence, veteran police officers and grassroots activists. In emotionally resonant and deeply personal interviews, the main characters discuss the impacts of systemic racism on society, the pervasive surveillance of low income communities of color, and the profound change brought about by courageous citizen videographers who are now “watching back.”  The installation is shown across 3 screens, and loops every 30 minutes.  It can be installed in it’s own room, creating an experience for people to come through at their own pace.  It would require a sound system, as well as some funding to ship projection equipment (screens, projectors, media players) from NYC.  Here are excerpts from the video: https://vimeo.com/185745057  EXOSUIT: The Exosuit is a futuristic suit of wearable, counter-surveillance body armor that is embedded with cameras and other technology designed to protect the wearer and monitor the police. It references afro-futurism, pop-culture and sci-fi. It can be displayed as an art piece and if possible, even worn by users. Including it in the run of AMC would require shipping the outfit from NYC to Detroit.    TRAININGS: The Trainings cover topics  “Know Your Rights”, the 200 year history of community lead police monitoring, envisioning community safety in the absence of police, and designing new tools to help empower communities to take back control.They are best paired with a screening of the 30 minute video and would require a room and anywhere from 10-30 participants.  We would love to discuss with you the possibility of bringing these creative, powerful elements to AMC.

We will host a community hack-a-thon to dive into the concept, improve the design together, and take next steps. Participants will leave with a deeper understanding of how police try to limit accountability and how innovative tech can change the power dynamic between the public and the police. 	Join The Argus Project for a community hack-a-thon to develope a new badge-reader and data-gathering technology giving everday people the power to hold police accountable.

Video games have the potential to be a medium for people on the margins to share their lived experience and artistic practice on a digital platform, as well as for communities to build contexts for themselves. However, the medium is often believed to be a solely commercialized outlet meant for mainstream narratives and formal skills development is often only available for those who can afford post-secondary education, a financial barrier compounded by the lack of racial, sexual, and gender diversity in the field.Recently, the Hand Eye Society adapted Game Curious into an open source template, working with independent creators across Canada to start Game Curious Montreal and Game Curious Vancouver.

Participants collectively envision solutions to real life barriers that prevent people from doing the change work they desire. They explore the nuances of interpersonal dynamics that are part of collective change and practice the skills needed to do this work in their own communities.

Sex workers have always relied on rhetorical, aesthetic, and poetic media to connect to one another, to clientele, and to the public.

MapThePower	Strategy Session (a 90-minute session that focuses collective brain power around hard questions and generates clear next steps)	Everyone	Zora Neale Hurston described research as “formalized curiosity,” and “poking and prying with a purpose.” Identifying where and with whom political power lies is a crucial part of organizing for systemic change. This session builds a foundation in the purpose of power research, highlights real-world examples where it has been applied by organizers to effect change, and leaves organizers with the tools to be more purposeful and effective pokers and pryers.	2	No	Gin Armstrong	ginarmstrong@gmail.com	716-239-8305	LittleSis	Gin Armstrong is the deputy director of the Public Accountability Initiative, the Buffalo, NY-based non-profit behind LittleSis, where she focuses on tracking the networks that prop up the power elite.

This panel features producers from the Disability Visibility Project™ (DVP) talking about the project inception and its accessibility and inclusion practices. Participants will leave with a better understanding of why accessibility benefits everyone and the importance of engagement with disability communities in their work 	#AccessAMC2017	Panel/Presentation (an interesting and engaging 90 minute presentation followed by Q&A. Panels with multiple speakers should include a moderator)	Everyone	Creating accessible media is essential in media-based organizing. Media that does reach certain groups is media that fails to connect/transform. The power of media and its messages are lost when creators do not serve all groups, such as people w/ disabilities. Creating accessible media removes barriers and decreases the power differential between media makers and consumers. Our session is a case example in how oral histories can improve by confronting and addressing their accessibility issues.	2	Yes	Alice Wong	DisabilityVisibilityProject@gmail.com  	415-867-1049	Founder and Project Coordinator Disability Visibility Project™	Alice Wong is a sociologist, research consultant, and disability activist based in San Francisco.

It is very hard emotional material and needs a lots of trust, so talking about people's experiences works best as a closed 3 hour session where folks can build trust.

By juxtaposing images, sounds, testimonies and narratives of the outsider with those of the people living there, we will collectively create an imaginary of the resilience, the joy, the heartening activism and mobility for social change, and the valuable flow of cultures and identities contained in the U.S-Mexico border. Participants will walk away understanding the importance of looking beyond dominant narratives and discourses, and instead search, listen and analyze the social imaginaries constructed by the voices, histories, music, performances, images and genealogies of the communities living in the borderlands.

Please see attached the full proposal for our session below.  Hacking Diversity: As educators in libraries, museums, and other institutions, how can we take advantage of existing “diversity and inclusion” initiatives to achieve more radical social change?

Describe the connection between your proposed session and the practice of media-based organizing:  The facilitators are two instructors that use media and technology extensively in our work -- one of us is a librarian that works with an online degree completion program, another is a college instructor of visual art, media, and performance. We are both called to doing “diversity work” at our universities, in part because of our social identities. This session is meant to collectively strategize ways that all of us--participants and facilitators--might better leverage media in our teaching and our diversity work. Some ways that we use media in our practice: innovating the technologies we use and assignments we create in online and offline classrooms; providing media literacy trainings and empowering students to harness social media, performance, and video as a tool for self-representation; using university funds and time to creating media for communities outside the university; supporting and collaborating with local artists and media-makers.															As librarians and educators, how can we take advantage of “diversity and inclusion” initiatives to achieve radical social change? In this session, we’ll explore how to hack diversity by harnessing media and learning technologies; developing inclusive classroom pedagogies; and directing “diversity” resources to support grassroots archives and communities. Participants will leave with ideas for working within their own institutions.

By juxtaposing images, sounds, testimonies and narratives of the outsider with those of the people living there, we will collectively create an imaginary of the resilience, the joy, the heartening activism and mobility for social change, and the valuable flow of cultures and identities contained in the U.S-Mexico border. Participants will walk away understanding the importance of looking beyond dominant narratives and discourses, and instead search, listen and analyze the social imaginaries constructed by the voices, histories, music, performances, images and genealogies of the communities living in the borderlands.

This workshop will cover: 1) the basics of encryption, along with digital privacy trends and recommendations from our online campaigners AND 2) the ways in which encryption can be as much about safety, as participation, style, and fun. We’ll help you make encryption #HumanAF.

Darris Young (agreed to attend if we can pay his airfare and hotel, which we are working on)	darris@ellabakercenter.org	510-428-3939	Ella Baker Center	Darris Young is on the staff of the Ella Baker Center, a group in Oakland, California, that builds the power of black, brown, and poor people to break the cycles of incarceration and poverty and make our communities safe, healthy, and strong. In 2008, while an inmate at Solano State Prison, Young co-organized a prison-wide work stoppage in response to the loss of recreation privileges for inmates. The strike was successful. Young now uses journalism to help reduce the prison population. 											We want this workshop to be steered by the audience. We will leave at least 30 minutes for audience comments and questions.   In 1996, thousands of people attended rallies in favor of saving the ancient Headwaters redwood forest in northern California from logging plans by Maxxam Corporation. Hundreds of people were arrested for non-violent, civil disobedience. As a result, the federal government bought 7,500 acres to create the Headwaters Forest Preserve.  In Houston, Texas in 2006, after a month-long strike, thousands of janitors who had been earning poverty wages, doubled their incomes and won health insurance for the first time. Most of the workers were women who had immigrated from Mexico and Central America. By going on strike, many were risking deportation.  Organizers of both these struggles told Eesha Williams that journalism in locally-owned news outlets helped their cause, while the corporate media either ignored them, or provided hostile coverage.   In December 2014, in Oakland, California, anti-prison activists held a rally outside a meeting of the county legislature. They were asking the Alameda county board of supervisors to invest $17 million a year in programs to keep people out of prison by creating jobs for people just getting out of prison. The board rejected the activists’ request. The activists kept returning to the board’s meetings and speaking out during the public comment period. But the board kept rejecting their request. On March 4, 2015, the activists returned to a county board meeting. This time they were ready to get arrested for non-violent civil disobedience. They interrupted the meeting by singing songs from the civil rights movement. The board quickly ended the meeting. Soon, the activists won. They got the $17 million.  There are two main newspapers in Oakland, the Oakland Tribune and the East Bay Express. The Tribune is owned by a corporation in Colorado that owns dozens of other newspapers around the nation. The East Bay Express is owned by a group of local people in Oakland.  There are several radio and TV stations that cover Oakland news. One of them is KPFA, a non-profit radio station whose board of directors is elected by anyone who donates $35 a year or volunteers four hours a year. KPFA rejects the corporate money that NPR stations rely on.  Darris Young was the main organizer of the protests at the Alameda county board of supervisors meeting. Williams spoke with him in September 2015. Young said the East Bay Express provided coverage that helped turn out people for the protest in March. He said the Tribune did not. KPFA has covered his group’s work better than the commercial radio and TV stations.															Journalism can change the world. This workshop will provide real world examples of news coverage from locally-owned radio stations, newspapers, and web sites around the nation that made a difference.

I will transform the youth’s perception by illuminating the positive and negative characteristics of hip hop, while attaining the attention of higher education administrators and hip hop leaders to realize that hip hop is a way of life for many Black youth.  	3	Yes	Dr. TashaDavis	tlong522@gmail.com	630-429-6143	Sisters of Survival	Dr. Tasha G. Davis is a hip hop artist, writer, and scholar born and raised in Cabrini Green, a housing project located in the inner city of Chicago; this is where her journey to education began.  Dr. Davis is the Associate Dean of Correctional Programs at Lake Land College where she is responsible for the coordination of vocational and academic post-secondary programs, while acting as liaison between the community college and the Department of Juvenile Justice Youth Center in St. Charles IL.																										U.S educational systems are built on the traditional models of superior and inferior beings.  The pedagogy, curriculum and history being taught only encourage, support, and uplift White privilege leaving many underrepresented underserved people of color excluded in traditional classrooms.  Discriminatory, separate but equal teachings of inferiority are being schooled into the minds of Black youth, leaving them insecure, uninspired, uneducated and incarcerated.  When Black girls and Black boys do not fit into the constructs of the traditional models of education, many are being disciplined and held accountable for challenging the policies of systematic oppression; these are methodical foundations upon which slavery were built.  The institution upon which slavery was built has a direct impact on the culture of hip-hop.  Tricia Rose’s definition of hip hop is used to ground the perspective of girls and women of color in the culture of hip hop.  Hip-hop according to Tricia Rose’s definition is an “Afrodiasporic music genre born in 1970’s New York, and offers a bridge between non-traditional ways of knowing and traditional curricula.  Music and cultural critics praise rap’s role as an educational tool, point out that Black women rappers are rare examples of aggressive pro-women lyricists, and defend rap’s ghetto stories as real life reflections that should draw attention to the burning problems of racism and economic oppression” (Rose 1994, p.1).  The conversation of inclusion is necessary with college administrators who design traditional curriculum, and with the music writers and admirers that generate and stimulate the culture of hip hop music.  Women and girls being embodied as leaders in the culture of hip-hop will have a direct impact on the exclusion they face on college campuses and as trailblazers in the genre of rap.  The culture of hip hop must become part of higher education interchange through a diversified curriculum developed as a college course.  The culture of hip-hop needs to be dissected, making connections to the lived experiences of underrepresented Black girls/women and their socially oppressed marginalized identities. Hip hop must serve as a radical resistance against systematic oppression, as a form of education, and be responsible for the messages that are being sent to Black youth today.  The culture of hip hop can serve as a critical pedagogy and educational movement used by Black men and Black women to help obtain knowledge of self, while bridging the gap to end mass incarceration, systematic traditional White privileged curriculum, and create diversity and inclusion within our institutions of education.  Mass incarceration is another form of systematic oppression that was established to enslave and destroy the lives of Black people from underserved communities.  Mass incarceration affects the lives of many poor Black men and Black women, leaving the Black family destroyed for generations.   Many working class Black women are bread winners, and serve as the head of their household. When a Black mother is incarcerated, her children are exposed to similar dysfunctions that plagued her life, which leads to generational imprisonment.  Systematic oppression, generational confinement, and White Privilege are the stimulus used to develop the school to prison pipeline for Black men and women.  In order to bring visibility to the oppressions of Black men and women in U.S. institutions of education, and U.S. systems of justice there must be a positive dialogue about Black women in culture of hip hop.  Through the use of a Critical Black Female Street Pedagogy (Davis Long, 2016), Black women will have a voice and framework that can be used to describe their lived experiences, leading to awareness, constructive rehabilitation, mental health, inclusion in the hip hop culture, and social justice.  															Through the dissection of hip hop lyrics with the youth, it is my intended outcome to make youth aware of the history of systematic oppression, show a correlation between the culture of hip hop, the purposeful exclusion of Black women, and the offering of traditional White Privileged curriculum. Youth will become knowledgeable enough to critically think, express their concerns about Women in hip hop, and why hip hop should become part of diversified college level curriculum

Historically, security tools are notoriously hard to use and generally seen as only for experts thus excluding a vast majority of the population. In this session, I will give a background on the issue, present a re-framing on how security and usability are integrally linked, then engage in a ~45min prototyping activity to give participants hands-on experience with user testing. 	#UsableSecurity	Hands-on Session (a 90 minute session that engages multiple senses in the learning process and allows participants to construct their own knowledge)	Intermediate	Media-based organizing is core to this session. Simply, as the world becomes digital, people need to understand how to manage their digital selves. That includes both sharing and not sharing. That is handled through security (or privacy) controls which many people find cumbersome or inaccessible. By encouraging designers to embrace usability, we actually improve democratic participation in a rapidly digitizing public.	1	No	Morgan Miller	MorganMillerUX@gmail.com	503-349-5292	Morgan Miller UX (my freelance company)	While studying cryptography in graduate school, I was amazed how most difficult most security tools were to use. Noticing the frequency of user-introduced security flaws, I became convinced that usability was the only way to advance crytographic tools. I have been a practicing UX architect since 2011. I have had the joy of working with many smart people to help build systems that meet business goals (security, profit, etc) and support user needs.  Please see http://MorganMillerUX.com																										I have given a couple forms of this talk as an invited speaker at Galois, at Open Source Bridge conference, and at Portland BSides. The interactive activity is a new addition that I think will be fun, provide peer learning opportunities, and be a way to give hands on tactics for envisioning privacy/security features in systems that are designed as well as user testing.
